# 🧬 KGGenie: AI-Powered Knowledge Graph for Cancer Research
KGGenie is an interactive, AI-enhanced platform for constructing and exploring biomedical knowledge graphs focused on cancer-related entities such as genes, pathways, diseases, and drug-target interactions. Built with Streamlit, it enables researchers to visualize complex relationships across oncogenes, cancer types, signaling pathways, and therapeutic compounds.

# 🌟 Key Features
🔎 Triplet-based knowledge graph from public biomedical databases (ChEMBL, DisGeNET, etc.)

🧠 Gene-pathway-disease-drug mapping using curated and programmatically extracted data

🧪 Bioactivity insights with SMILES, binding affinities, and drug approval status

🖼️ Interactive Streamlit interface for querying and visualizing cancer mechanisms

📚 Modular design for easy extension to other diseases or datasets

# 🧠 Example Use Case
Explore associations like:

◘ BRCA1 → Homologous recombination pathway → Triple Negative Breast Cancer

◘ EGFR → PI3K-Akt signaling → Lung Cancer and targeted therapies from ChEMBL

◘ TP53 → p53 signaling → Glioblastoma, Breast, Colorectal cancers
